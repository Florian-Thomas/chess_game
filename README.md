# Chess game with Monte-Carlo Tree Search Algorithm and Minimax


## Run

To launch the game, run Launcher.py.

You can then choose the game mode between Player vs Player, Player vs AI and AI vs AI. If an AI is used, the time limit given to the AI must be specified in seconds.

You will also be asked if you want to play first or not. The white player always plays first in chess.

To move a piece, select it with your left click. You will see the different possible moves with red dots and can then left click on the chosen one. If you have selected a piece and changed your mind, you can unselect it using the right click.
